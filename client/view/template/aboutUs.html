               <p>On one Winter evening, my uncle and I were discussing my time at the UW. Our conversation steered in the direction of textbook prices: something that all college students can wholeheartedly agree on. Textbooks are expensive. My uncle asked if my school had any kind of textbook exchange program for its students to use. I told him that there is a Facebook group where students can put whatever they have up for sale. The problem was that it still involved money. After googling to see if such a program existed, I asked myself “why not make something that does just that?”</p>
               <p>
               After months of mentorship and development, I proudly present the website ILendBooks™. Lend books and earn BookCoin™ which you can use to borrow books from other students! College textbooks are expensive, and I sincerely believe ILendBooks™ can alleviate the grievances and efficiently solve this issue.</p>
